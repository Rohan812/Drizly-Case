Drizly is an online liqour store that fulfulls customer orders by delivering the orders from the retailers to the customers.
During COVID, the webiste saw a huge spike to lockdowns in major areas of US. Drizly encountered various difficultites that affected their efficiency.
Many orders were delayed and at worse cancelled after several hours sometimes due to unavailability of stock or due to biasness of the retailers to fulfill orders with high Gross Merchandise value (GMV).
The projects tries to address the reasons of the delay by answering some questions.
Hope you enjoy exploring the project!!!
Have a nice day!!
